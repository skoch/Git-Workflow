     git flow release finish '1.0'
</pre>
        <p>The very first thing you need to do is to update the version in your <a href="readme.html">README</a> file. Do it, do it now by opening the README and creating a new entry for this version (unless you can fill in the details as well):</p>
        <pre>
#### 1.0 - 2015-08-31
* Initial commit</pre>

        <p>Commit this using an appropriate commit message:</p>
        <pre>$ git commit -am "Bumped version number to 1.0"</pre>
        <p>Make any last minute updates/changes. <strong>NO FEATURE DEVELOPMENT!</strong></p>

          You will be prompted three times to enter a commit message using `vi`! The only one you will have to insert is for the tags; the other 2 can be dismissed with <code>:wq</code> (effectively using the already inserted text for the message.)
